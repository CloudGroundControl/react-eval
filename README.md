# react-eval

This exercise will help us evaluate your experience with UX/UI and the react framework.

## Exercise

You will create a web application with 2 pages:
- an `/home` landing page
- a `/login` page

If the user isn't logged in, the application will redirect to the `/login` page and ask the user to log in. If successful, the application will redirect the user to the landing `/home` page.
If the user is logged in, the application will display the `/home` landing page.

For the sake of the exercise, username and password will be respectively `admin` and `password`.

## Deliverable

To be successful in this exercise, your submission should:
- be a Github repository
- be a React application
